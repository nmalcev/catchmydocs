This is the next version of the RTE component based on the contentediatble feature, which does not use the deprecated `execCommand()` API.

Pros:
- no restrictions (the previous version works with a limited number of font sizes);
- there is no outdated status of the APIs used.

Cons:
- All API methods are not implemented.
